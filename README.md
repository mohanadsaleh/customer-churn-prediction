# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques with the XGBoost classifier. The model helps identify customers likely to leave a service based on various features.

## Project Overview

- Dataset: Telco customer churn dataset.
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler.
- Model: XGBoost classifier with default parameters.
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
- Model and scaler saved for future use.

## Installation

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost joblib
